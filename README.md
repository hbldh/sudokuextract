# Sudoku Extract

Library for extracting Sudokus from images using [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org//).

## Boosting Algorithms

The skboost package contains implementations of some boosting algorithms that
are outside the scope of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

The main point of interest is the MILBoost algorithm, which performs boosting
with a Multiple Instance Learning formulation.
